# Voice preview samples

Add short (~10–15 second) MP3 files here for the Advanced tab voice gallery. Filenames expected by the app:

- `warm-friendly.mp3`
- `professional.mp3`
- `calm.mp3`
- `energetic.mp3`
- `authoritative.mp3`
- `warm-casual.mp3`
- `clear-neutral.mp3`
- `empathetic.mp3`
- `confident.mp3`
- `friendly-default.mp3`

Until these files exist, "Play sample" may fail to load; the UI will handle errors gracefully.
